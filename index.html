        <h3>Data Science</h3>
        <p class="data-description">I was not aware about this technology at the earliest.I came through terms like bigdata and the related job roles and I
           was eager to know what does these mean.Two three months ago,I realized the importance of this and I was eager to learn
            about this.In the present situation,all fields are turning to be digitized and perday millions and trillions of data
            are generated.So its wonderful to study on these data and to generate patterns that would be useful for the society.
